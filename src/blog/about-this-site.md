I built this site with my own little fingers, pecking hen-like on a keyboard.
I host it from an old Dell computer salvaged from a dumpster, which now sits in a corner of my daughter’s bedroom, where I work in the company of stuffed animals and crafts brought home from school.  
  
I built this site to see how it is done, and to understand what it means to <em>host</em>, which like so many terms in my world of IT, is a word taken from ordinary language and tortured into meaning something completely different. Learning the language of technology takes a bit of unlearning the language of humanity.  

We borrow words for things we once understood to describe things we just made up: objects that are not objects at all, kernels, utilities, protocols, instances, shadows, and children that spawn siblings, run-times and user-spaces, images and snapshots, layers and stacks, and on and on, a taxonomy of things that barely exist, a jungle of strange, digital creatures.

I built this site to make up for my weak online presence.  
I built this site to have a place to dump some of the crap I write.  
I built this site as a joke, and for fun, though I may have overestimated that part.  
I built this site to give myself a voice, in the event that I might have something important to say.

The truth is, I don’t know why I built this site. It seemed like a good idea. 

And now that it is built, it turns out it was a good idea. What it has given me, I now see, is a laboratory. A place to experiment, both with technology, and ideas.

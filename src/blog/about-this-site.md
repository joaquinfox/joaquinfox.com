I built this site with my own two fingers, pecking away hen-like on a keyboard.  
It is hosted on an old Dell computer salvaged from a dumpster, which now sits in a corner of my daughterâ€™s bedroom, where I work in the company of stuffed animals and crafts brought home from school.

I built it to see how it is done, to learn by doing, to wrestle, mano a mano, with arcane concepts from my chosen field of IT infrastructure. In IT we borrow words for ordinary things and bend them to describe a jungle of strange, digital creatures. Like every industry we have our jargon. But oftentimes the objects we describe have no good analog in the physical world. You can only grasp so much by reading. You have to play the game.

I had other reasons to build this site. It  gives me  a place to put my writing, but not too public a place, since I like attention, but not too much attention. I think I also built this site as a bit of a joke, and for fun, though I may have overestimated that part. On some level, I built this site to give myself a voice, in the event that I might have something important to say.

I can spot these reasons in hind sight, but the truth is that I had no clear goal in mind. It just seemed like a good idea. And now that it is built, I think it was a good idea. What it has given me, I now see, is a laboratory. A place to experiment, both with technology, and ideas.

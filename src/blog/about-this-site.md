I built this site with my own little fingers, pecking, hen-like on a keyboard.
I host it from an old Dell computer I salvaged from a dumpster, and which now sits in a corner of my daughter’s bedroom, where I work, in the company of stuffed animals and crafts brought home from school.
I built this site, to see how it is done, and to understand what it means to host, which like so many terms in my world of IT, is a word stolen shamelessly from ordinary language and tortured into meaning something completely different. There is a sense in which learning the language of technology requires unlearning the language of humanity.
We borrow words for things we once understood to describe things we just made up: objects that are not objects at all, kernels, utilities, protocols, instances, shadows, and children that spawn siblings, run-times and user-spaces, images and snapshots, layers and stacks, and on and on, a taxonomy of things that barely exist, a jungle of strange, digital creatures.

I built this site to make up for my weak online presence.
I built this site to have a place to dump all the crap I write.
I built this site as a joke, and for fun, though I may have overestimated how fun it would be.
I built this site to give myself a voice, in the event that I might have something important to say.

The truth is, I don’t know why I built this site. It seemed like a good idea. 

But now that it is built, it does seem to have been a good idea. What it has turned out to be, I am now realizing is a laboratory. A place to experiment, both with technology, and ideas.

I dislike a lot of things about the online world. In particular, I dislike the social networks, and the way these corporations have co-opted public discourse. They have inserted themselves, uninvited into our conversation. They have commoditized and taken control of my ability to talk to you, to learn from you, and to form a bond with you. And they have done a miserable job of it.

I think we would have a better web and a better world if we left them out of the conversation. Wouldn’t it be nice to speak on our terms, through platforms that we built and which we control and which serve our need for discourse and community and not their need for profit. 

Well, we have the tools to do exactly that. By an incredible stroke of good luck, the pioneers of the early web had a very human vision for the internet to be. It was idealistic, in the best sense of the word.

And this web that they built, and have left for us, give us the ability to build our own websites, and to speak to the world on our terms, without the manipulation and intrusiveness of the corporate social media.

You can look into the guts of this website here. Maybe you will be inspired to make a site of your own.

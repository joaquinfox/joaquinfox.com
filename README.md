I built this website with my own two index fingers. It’s static — no database, no server-side scripts, nothing changes when you click around. It’s a digital poster: simple, stable, and yours to replicate.
I’m using Eleventy as a static site generator. It takes files I write — Markdown, mostly — and turns them into HTML, the universal language of the web. It also applies templates, so everything stays consistent. Honestly, it’s probably overkill. This site would run just fine on plain HTML, CSS, and JS.
You could build a site like this. You should. It helps keep the web public, open, and decentralized. It’s also good to understand the foundational tech of our time — call it basic literacy. While I’m not in the tutorial business, I offer this walkthrough as inspiration for anyone inclined to make something of their own.

### File Structure
* _includes
  * layout.njk  - The _includes folder is an eleventy convention and is used to hold re-usable templates, which I use to format posts. The .njk file type lets eleventy use a templating language called Nunjucks, which is what gives eleventy its magic.
*  assets - This is where I keep images.

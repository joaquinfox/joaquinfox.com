<p>Maybe you always wanted to be a dad. Or maybe fatherhood was something you tried to avoid. Maybe it scared you. Maybe it scares you still.</p>
<p>But now, however you got here, here you are—a father. And you always will be. And nothing in your life will be quite the same. I hope the changes and experiences you have as a new father will be as wonderful as mine have been.</p>
<p>I became a dad in my 50s, when I fell in love with and married the mother of a one-year-old. Having a family and raising a child with a committed partner has been the most extraordinary and meaningful experience of my life. In this short post, I am going to share some of my experience and reflect on its meaning.</p>
<p>We all know there are lousy dads. You might know a few. There is nothing about the act of having kids that makes us better men or makes our role in the world a positive one. But I believe that if you embrace your new role with real intention and a desire to give your kid the best possible future, that this in turn gives you something beautiful and truly unique. Fatherhood, and parenting in a willful way, can give you a connection to your own past and an investment in the future that is both deeply socializing and motivating.</p>
<p><strong>Here is my first claim:</strong><br>
When we parent in an intentional way, we learn what a child needs, and in that way, we learn what we needed—and did or did not receive—when we were kids. We can use this information to learn about ourselves. This understanding can give us some compassion for the men we have become. We can learn something about the origins of our angers and fears, and in learning these things, gain an upper hand over our inner demons.</p>
<p>Our children—all children—are so incredibly vulnerable, for such an incredibly long time. While societies love stories of resilient children raised by wolves to become lords of the jungle, or kids who survive abuse or war, or rise from poverty to become inspirational beacons, we know that these are mostly just stories. There was no Tarzan, no Mowgli. And for every abused or neglected child that overcomes their disadvantage and who then goes on to tell of it, there are thousands more who are forever only broken and shackled by their past.</p>
<p><strong>Here then is my second claim:</strong><br>
Raising your child well is very likely to be the most important thing you will do in your life. You might aspire to more than “just” being a good parent. I hope you do, and I wish you success in those aspirations. But the vast majority of us will not stop or start wars or cure diseases or build empires or become wealthy or gain any celebrity.</p>
<p>We are, most of us, people with little power or status or wealth. For us, the act of anticipating, preparing for, and striving for our children's best possible future is likely the single most powerful deed we will perform in this life. And just as important, this act of devotion to our children is an act of devotion to the future.</p>
<p>So welcome to fatherhood. Enjoy it. Embrace it.</p>
